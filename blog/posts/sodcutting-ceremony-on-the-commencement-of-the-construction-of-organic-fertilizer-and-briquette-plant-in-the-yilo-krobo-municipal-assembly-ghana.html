            <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The
construction of a fertiliser production factory under the one district one
factory has commenced in Somanya in the Yilo Krobo Municipality, to process
both faecal and bio-degradable waste.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The
construction of the factory is part of the “Creating and Capturing Value”
(Capval) project launched in 2015 by the International Water Management
Institute (IWMI) and Jekora Ventures Limited with support from the Netherlands
Enterprise Agency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The
Capval project seeks to demonstrate that sanitation and waste management could
support a circular economy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At
a ceremony to outdoor the construction of the fertiliser production factory, Dr
Josiane Nikiema, the Representative from IWMI, said the Institute was focused
on the sustainable use of water and land resources in developing countries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She
said for more than a decade, IWMI had been exploring ways to recover useful
materials from waste generated in urban setting such as waste water, faecal
sludge and agro industrial waste among others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dr
Nikiema said the smaller facility would be positioned to produce 200 metric
tonnes of compost annually by transforming 5,000 cubic metres of faecal sludge
and 300 metric tonnes of solid waste.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She
said there would also be the bigger processor within the factory, which would
produce 1,000 tonnes of low cost fuel briquettes annually for use by households
and institutions in the Municipality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On
his part, Mr Eric Kwakye Dafour, the Eastern Regional Minister, said the siting
of the plant would help in making good use of waste generated in the community
and its environs such as maize husk, adding that it was commendable as waste
products over the years, had posed many environmental problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He
said there was no doubt that Agriculture was the major economic activity in the
Yilo Krobo Municipality, adding that the farmers relied heavily on fertilisers
to cultivate crops due to the land tenure system.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr
Dafuor said the coming of the fertiliser factory into the Municipality would
help farmers to readily get access to fertilisers to grow their crops for
successful outcomes each season.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He
commended the Netherlands Enterprise Agency and other partners who are
supporting financially to bring this project into fruition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ms
Katja Lasseur, the Deputy Ambassador of the Netherlands to Ghana, said the
Netherlands Government had committed itself to the dealing with the available
resources in a smarter way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She
said: “We are trying to consume less and maximise the reuse of raw materials
with the aim of having a circular economy in 2050”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ms
Lasseur said the country was committed to working with other nations to achieve
its aim and in the process learn from partner counties like Ghana and that the
Capital Project was a perfect example of such partnership.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr
I. B. Nartey-Tokli, the Managing Director of Jekora Ventures Limited, said the
construction of the factory would pave way for its inauguration early next
year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He
said the contractor was selected from the Municipality and that all the
artisans working on the project are from the community as part of ensuring that
there was strong local content in the entire process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr
Nartey-Tokli said Jekora Ventures anticipated the construction of the factory
and subsequent operation of the facility, a local solution, using low cost
appropriate technology.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mr
Ebenezer Tetteh Kupualor, the Municipal Chief Executive of the Yilo Krobo
Municipal Assembly, said one of the highest expenditure on the Assembly’s fund
was management, which takes about 23 per cent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He
said equipment, labour and land were three critical resources needed for a
sustainable waste management but the availability of land had become very
difficult challenge to the Assembly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He
said management waste had become one of the main challenges for most local
authorities and that the Municipality was no exception, adding that, the
commencement of the factory in the Municipality would empower them in the
effective management of waste.</p>
