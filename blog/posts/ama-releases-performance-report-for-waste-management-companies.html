            <p class="lead text-xl text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">The Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) has released a report on the performance of the various waste management companies operating in the metropolis for the ...</p>

<p>The <a class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400 hover:underline" href="https://ama.gov.gh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA)</a> has released a report on the performance of the various waste management companies operating in the metropolis for the third quarter of 2018 based on their service zones within six sub metros.

The report evaluates the performance of six (6) contractors namely J. Stanley Owusu and Co. Limited (<strong>Okaikoi South</strong>), Metropolitan Waste and Allied Services (<strong>Ablekuma South and Central</strong>), Zoomlion Domestic Waste Services (<strong>Ablekuma Central and Ayawaso Central</strong>), Meskworld Co. Limited (<strong>Ashiedu Keteke</strong>), Tropical Waste Limited (<strong>Ashiedu Keteke</strong>) and <a class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400 hover:underline" href="https://jekoraventures.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jekora Ventures Limited</a> (<strong>Osu Klottey</strong>).

Deputy Head of Waste Management, Victor Kotey who briefed journalists in Accra on Monday, said indicators used for the evaluation were derived from the Fee and Performance Based Solid Waste Collection Service Franchise Agreement between respective service providers and the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) signed in August 2016.

These, he said, includes the ability to register all premises in service zones, maintain a register of all premises receiving service, supply ‘Standard solid waste bins (plastic or metallic), promote recycling, integrate informal waste collectors as well as service clients regularly.

The rest are collaboration with relevant departments to ensure clean environment, service coverage, maintenance of designated sanitary sites, provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) at all times, submission of monthly reports and innovation in the collection of market waste.

He disclosed that, whiles none of the service providers were able to secure marks above 85% for excellent performance, <a class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400 hover:underline" href="https://jekoraventures.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jekora Ventures</a>, performed satisfactorily scoring <strong>80.6%</strong>.

He noted that remaining service providers in seven service zones performed below average with the following scores:

ZOOMLION DOMESTIC/ AYAWASO CENTRAL - <strong>61.8%</strong>

ZOOMLION DOMESTIC/ ABLEKUMA CENTRAL - <strong>61.5%</strong>

METROPOLITAN &amp; ALLIED /ABLEKUMA CENTRAL - <strong>43.0%</strong>

STANLEY OWUSU &amp; CO. LTD / OKAIKOI SOUTH - <strong>40.7%</strong>

METROPOLITAN &amp; ALLIED WASTE ABLEKUMA SOUTH - <strong>36.0%</strong>

TROPICAL WASTE / ASHIEDU KETEKE - <strong>28.3%</strong>

MESKWORLD LIMITED / ASHIEDU KETEKE - <strong>22.1%</strong>

He said data on household registration, bins supplied, equipment holding and tour schedules were collected from service providers using formats provided by the Waste Management Department for the performance evaluation process adding that the assessment was categorized into two sections: Capacity of Service Providers and Actual Service Delivery Performance.

He disclosed that Jekora Ventures, during the assessment, were innovative by engaging in compost production, pilot waste segregation, and provided incentives for corporate clients who properly separated their waste among others.

"The service provider collaborated with AMA and other stakeholders to introduce innovations and improve services. One of such collaboration was “Mayor’s Pilot Waste Segregation” in basic schools in the Osu Klottey Sub Metro he said adding that, on capacity of contractors equipment holding, Jekora  had adequate resources to provide efficient services but lacked back up for skip trucks.

He urged all service providers to improve their services to achieve targets set in the Franchise Agreement within their respective timelines, promote reduction and recycling, increase working interactions with the Waste Management and Metro Public Health Departments of the Assembly as well as increase service coverage.

Mr. Desmond Appiah, Chief Sustainability Adviser to the Mayor of Accra, emphasized that the assessment were part of the service contacts signed between the Assembly and the respective waste management companies and not a one-off assessment.

He added that the purpose of the report was to ensure that contractors and clients are conscious of their responsibilities within the contracts.

He noted that some concerns raised by contractors during the period were the unwillingness on the part of households and shop owners to pay for service rendered resulting in poor cash flow as well as inadequate public education and sensitization.
