              Who We Are
            </h3>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
              Jekora Ventures Limited is Ghana's leading wholly-owned Ghanaian
              environmental solutions company, pioneering sustainable waste
              management since 2003. We are trailblazers in creating resilient,
              sustainable solutions aimed at improving Ghana's environment and
              public health. Our core business is delivering dependable solid
              waste collection for residential, commercial, and industrial
              clients across several municipal assemblies under Public-Private
              Partnership (PPP) franchise agreements.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6">
              We specialize in a comprehensive suite of services, from
              door-to-door solid waste collection to drain and beach cleansing.
              As the first and only Ghanaian waste management company to offer
              an incentive-based source segregation and recycling program, we
              are leaders in transforming waste into valuable resources like
              compost, paper pulp, and plastic pellets.

          Our Story
        </h3>
        <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-6">
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <strong class="theme-gold">Our Foundation: </strong>Established in
            2003, Jekora Ventures began its journey with a focus on cleaning
            services, undertaking a routine maintenance contract for the Accra
            Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) at the bustling Odornaa main lorry park.
            Through determination and a commitment to excellence, we discharged
            our duties with distinction, which inspired our entry into the solid
            waste collection business. By 2004, we were appointed as a Solid
            Waste Contractor for the city, a testament to our early performance
            and growing ambition to tackle Ghana's environmental challenges.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <strong class="theme-gold">Our Growth Journey: </strong>Beginning in
            2008, we launched an aggressive expansion, investing in a modern
            fleet of refuse vehicles and a highly motivated professional team.
            This enabled us to grow from a promising contractor into a
            fully-fledged waste management leader, securing franchise agreements
            with the Korle Klottey (KOKMA), Adentan (AdMA), and Weija Gbawe
            (WGMA) Municipal Assemblies. A pivotal moment came in 2012 when,
            faced with a tripling of haulage distances to landfills, we made a
            major policy shift to focus on diverting waste through source
            segregation and recycling—a decision that has defined our innovative
            approach ever since.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <strong class="theme-gold">Our Position Today: </strong>Today,
            Jekora Ventures stands as a testament to what is possible when
            environmental responsibility meets business innovation. With over
            200 employees, a fleet capacity of over 13,000 metric tonnes per
            month, and multiple awards for our work in sustainable development,
            we are the leading innovator in waste valorization in Ghana. We
            continue to lead the charge towards a circular economy, proving that
            you can build a sustainable business while promoting a healthier
            Ghana.
