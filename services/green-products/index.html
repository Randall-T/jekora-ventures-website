            As part of our commitment to environmental sustainability, Jekora
            Ventures is a leader in transforming local waste into valuable
            resources, creating green products for Ghanaians. We are proud to be
            the first and only Ghanaian waste management company to offer an
            incentive-based source segregation and recycling program, rewarding
            clients for their commitment to a greener future.

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Our green products are the direct result of these efforts. By
            composting organic and fecal waste, we produce all-natural,
            nutrient-rich soil conditioners that enhance agricultural
            productivity, reduce pollution, and support the Ghanaian economy.
