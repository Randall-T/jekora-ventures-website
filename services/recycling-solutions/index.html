            Jekora Ventures is proud to be the first and only Ghanaian waste
            management company to offer a comprehensive, incentive-based
            recycling program alongside solid waste source segregation. Our
            pioneering program rewards commercial and industrial clients with
            discounts on their monthly bills for efficiently segregating their
            waste into recyclable streams.

          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            With over 120 businesses participating, we are making the principle
            of recycling a practical and beneficial reality in Accra. While this
            service is currently focused on our commercial clients in the Osu
            Klottey and Adentan municipalities, residents are welcome to drop
            off sorted recyclables at our stations in Asylum Down, Odawna, or
            Jamestown.
